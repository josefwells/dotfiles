# DESCRIPTION (NOTES):
#   A script to be sourced from .bashrc to provide ways to archive all the
#   actions in infinitely long history file.
#
#   To use, just place
#     '[ -r ~/.bashrc_history ] && source ~/.bashrc_history' in ~/.bashrc
#
#     '$if Bash
#      # to exit through calling exit function which will archive the history
#      # next ones are optional: first is left for historical reasons
#      "\C-x\C-x": "exit\n"
#      "\C-x\C-w": "archive_history\n"
#      $endif'                   in ~/.inputrc
#
#   Then whenever you close bash (exit,logout or exit by pressing Ctrl-D
#   or Ctrl-X twice you will have a piece of current history added to
#   ~/.bash_history.archive
#
#   Thanks to Philippe Teuwen for the comments and "patches"
